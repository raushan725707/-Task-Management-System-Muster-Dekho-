Setting Up the Backend (Spring Boot):
Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository containing the Spring Boot backend code from GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Open the Project:

Open the project in your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
Configure the Database:

Ensure that you have a compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) installed and running on your system.
Update the database configurations (e.g., URL, username, password) in the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources directory.
Build the Project:

Build the project to resolve dependencies and compile the code:
bash
Copy code
./mvnw clean install
Run the Application:

Run the Spring Boot application using the following command:
arduino
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
This will start the backend server, and it will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
Setting Up the Frontend (React):
Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

Navigate to the directory containing the React frontend code.
Install Dependencies:

Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
Copy code
npm install
or
Copy code
yarn install
Configure API Endpoint:

Open the src/constants.js file and ensure that the API endpoint is correctly configured to http://localhost:8080 or the appropriate URL where your backend server is running.
Run the Development Server:

Start the development server to run the React application:
sql
Copy code
npm start
or
sql
Copy code
yarn start
This will start the frontend server, and the application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
Access the Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Task Management System application.
Additional Notes:
Make sure that both the backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (React) servers are running simultaneously for the application to function properly.
You may need to tweak the configurations or dependencies based on your specific environment or requirements.
Ensure that your system meets the prerequisites for running both Spring Boot and React applications.
With these steps, you should be able to successfully set up and run the Task Management System application on your local machine
